# Packaging and releases

## Build locally

```bash
npm run desktop:build   # web UI + Electron main/preload (API server bundled in)
npm run desktop:start   # run it
npm run desktop:dist    # installers for the current OS into ./release
npm run e2e             # Playwright against the built app
```

`CIPHERKEEP_E2E_BIN=/path/to/Cipherkeep npx playwright test` runs the same end-to-end test against an installed or packaged build.

Targets: Windows NSIS installer + portable `.exe`; macOS universal `.dmg` (arm64 + x86_64); Linux AppImage, `.deb`, `.rpm`. Pushing a `v*` tag runs `.github/workflows/release.yml`, which builds all of them and attaches them to a **draft** release. CI (`ci.yml`) runs lint, types, unit tests and the Electron e2e on all three OSes for every push.

## How the app is put together

The Electron main process starts the Fastify API on `127.0.0.1` with an ephemeral port and a random per-launch bearer token, and serves the built web UI from the same origin. The preload script (sandboxed, context-isolated) hands the page that token and a handful of validated actions (open an http(s)/mailto link, reveal a file in the file manager, change the data folder). The window cannot load anything from the network: every request to another origin is cancelled, permission prompts are denied, new windows and navigations away are blocked. See `SECURITY.md` once written, and `apps/desktop/src/security.ts` for the rules.

## Data folder

`%APPDATA%\Cipherkeep` · `~/Library/Application Support/Cipherkeep` · `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/Cipherkeep` (or `~/.config/Cipherkeep`). Electron's own files (Chromium profile, single-instance socket, window position) live in the hidden `.electron-session` folder inside it and are excluded from backups. Override with `CIPHERKEEP_DATA_DIR` (the whole app then lives in that folder) or Settings → Data folder → Change… (optionally copies your data, then restarts).

## Unsigned builds: what users will see

- **macOS**: Gatekeeper says the app "can't be opened because Apple cannot check it". Right-click → Open once, or `xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /Applications/Cipherkeep.app`.
- **Windows**: SmartScreen shows "Windows protected your PC". "More info" → "Run anyway".
- **Linux**: AppImage needs `chmod +x`; `.deb`/`.rpm` install normally.

There is no auto-update (no network access in v1), so a new version means installing over the old one; your data folder is separate and untouched.

## Adding signing later

1. **macOS**: an Apple Developer ID Application certificate. In `electron-builder.yml` remove `identity: null` and `hardenedRuntime: false`, set `hardenedRuntime: true`, add `notarize: true`, and provide `CSC_LINK`, `CSC_KEY_PASSWORD`, `APPLE_ID`, `APPLE_APP_SPECIFIC_PASSWORD`, `APPLE_TEAM_ID` as repository secrets passed to the "Package" step.
2. **Windows**: a code-signing certificate (EV for instant SmartScreen reputation) or Azure Trusted Signing. Set `CSC_LINK`/`CSC_KEY_PASSWORD` (or the `azureSignOptions` block).
3. **Linux**: optionally sign the repository metadata for `.deb`/`.rpm` when publishing a package repo.

Never commit certificates or passwords; keep them in GitHub secrets.
